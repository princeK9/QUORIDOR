
# CAPSTONE PROJECT ::: QUORIDOR

This is our final capstone project of our first year PDS LAB
We have tried to make a game inspired from board game QUORIDOR 
using C language.


## Appendix :: information
The abstract strategy game Quoridor is surprisingly deep for its
simple rules. The object of the game is to advance your pawn to 
the opposite edge of the board. On your turn you may either move 
your pawn or place a wall. You may hinder your opponent with wall 
placement, but not completely block them off. Meanwhile, they are 
trying to do the same to you. The first pawn to reach the opposite
 side wins.
 


## KEY FEATURES

we have developed some commands to help the players have better interface and understanding of their gameplay.
- WALL
walls allow each pawn to block the path of their opponent, both horizontally and vertically.
the command wall helps the player to know the number of walls left with it.
- SHOW
we made a notationboard inspired from chess where every move of the player is stored in real time and any player can print this notation table with the help of this command.
- RULE
this command helps the user to print the rulecard of the game where basic rules of the game are written in brief.
- QUIT
this command helps or allows any of the player to end the game at any point of time in the middle of the game.


## Roadmap

we strategically distributed the portions or subparts of the
  main code within our team(group of 3)
  
  - print the gameboard
  - print the notation table
  - validation of input
  - validation of moves
  - commands
  - organise all the functions




## Tech

## Deployment

To deploy this project run
- download the source code
- save the file in .c format with file name FINAL_SOURCE_CODE.code
- open a new terminal and run the code 

```bash
  gcc FINAL_SOURCE_CODE.c
  ./a.exe
```
